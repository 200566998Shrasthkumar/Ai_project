# Railway Safety Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes railway safety data from the [Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB)](https://tsb.gc.ca/eng/stats/rail/data-5.html). The dataset provides insights into railway accidents, incidents, and operational statistics across Canada.

## Objectives
- To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on railway safety data.
- To identify trends and patterns in railway accidents and incidents.
- To develop predictive models for accident forecasting.
- To visualize key findings for better understanding and communication.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the official TSB website and includes information such as:
- Accident and incident counts
- Location data
- Type of occurrences
- Casualties and damages
- Reporting timelines

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Visualization Tools:** Tableau / Power BI
- **Version Control:** GitHub

## Project Structure

```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/200566998Shrasthkumar/Exploring-and-Predicting-Rail-Occurrences-in-Canada.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Exploring-and-Predicting-Rail-Occurrences-in-Canada
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Run the Jupyter notebooks inside the `reports/` directory to explore the data.
- Modify the `src/` scripts to preprocess and analyze the data further.
- Use visualization tools to create dashboards based on the processed data.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Collection:** Download and clean the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize data trends and patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Prepare data for modeling.
4. **Model Training:** Build predictive models.
5. **Evaluation:** Assess model performance.
6. **Reporting:** Generate insights and visualization reports.

## Results
- Initial findings will be shared in the `reports/` directory.
- Visualizations highlight trends and potential safety concerns.

## Future Work
- Incorporate real-time data sources for ongoing analysis.
- Improve prediction accuracy using advanced machine learning models.
- Automate data processing pipelines.
